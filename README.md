# PHASE1 PROJECT
This project involves inputting statusCode to generate a cat's image.

## Objective:
Enter statusCode, generate the cat's image then clear.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well-written README.

## Requirements
- Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. - All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. Free APIs that require no authorization will be easiest 
   to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth API links to an external site. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to Git Hub!

- Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

- Use at least 3 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 3 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need 
    to add at least 2 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's 
     .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

- Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

- Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) using functions to abstract repetitive code.


## System Requirements

- A browser capable of running JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Operating System (Windows 10+, MacOS, Linux, etc.)
- A text editor capable of running JavaScript (Visual Studio Code, Vim, Nano, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.)
- RAM >= 4GB
- Disk space >= 1GB

## Installation

To use this repo, follow these steps:

1.  Open the terminal/CLI on your computer.

2.  Create a folder.
3.  Create three files(HTML, CSS,JS).

4.  Open it in your Code Editor of choice. If you use VS Code, run the command:

        code.

### Running the application

- With the `index.html` file still running in your browser, input any statusCode and click the generate cat's image button.

### Technologies.
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
